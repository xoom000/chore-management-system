# Development Notes - Chore Management System

## Project Summary
We've built a household chore management system that allows parents to assign and track chores for their children, with internet access control as an incentive/consequence mechanism. The system integrates with the family's router (with special support for Asus RT-BE92U) to enable/disable internet access based on chore completion.

## System Architecture
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Frontend**: React with Material-UI
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Router Integration**: SSH-based control for Asus routers

## Current Status
- Complete backend implementation with all necessary APIs
- Working frontend with core pages (Dashboard, Login, Chore management)
- Router control integration specifically for Asus routers with SSH access
- Automated installer script that handles all dependencies and configuration
- Published to GitHub at: https://github.com/xoom000/chore-management-system

## What We've Accomplished
1. **Core System**
   - User management (parents/children)
   - Chore definition and assignment
   - Chore completion and verification
   - Notification system

2. **Router Integration**
   - Router control via SSH for Asus routers
   - Internet access management based on chore completion
   - MAC address filtering for specific devices

3. **Installation Improvements**
   - Interactive installer script
   - Support for various Linux distributions
   - Automatic dependency installation
   - System service configuration

4. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive README
   - Setup guide for different environments
   - Future feature roadmap

## Where We Left Off
The project is in a fully functional state. We've completed:
- Core functionality development
- Router integration
- Repository setup on GitHub
- Future features roadmap

The system is ready for testing and real-world deployment.

## Next Steps
When we pick this up again, these would be the logical next areas to focus on:

1. **Testing and Refinement**
   - Real-world testing with actual family usage
   - Gather feedback on user experience
   - Fix any bugs that emerge from testing

2. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Improve responsiveness for mobile browsers
   - Consider developing companion mobile apps

3. **Feature Expansion**
   - Implement priority features from FUTURE_FEATURES.md
   - Start with mobile app development
   - Expand router support beyond Asus models

4. **Security Hardening**
   - Security audit of existing code
   - Implement additional authentication options
   - Add data backup and recovery options

## Development Environment
- The project is developed in a Linux environment
- Repository hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/xoom000/chore-management-system
- Uses npm for package management

## Deployment Instructions
To deploy and test the current version:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the automated installer: `./install.sh`
3. Follow the interactive prompts
4. Access the web application at http://[server-ip]:3000

## Technical Debt and Known Issues
- Currently optimized for Asus routers - would benefit from broader router support
- Frontend could use additional polish for mobile devices
- No automated tests implemented yet
- Would benefit from CI/CD pipeline setup for future development
- Application requires increased Node.js memory allocation (--max-old-space-size=4096)

## User Credentials for Testing
For testing purposes, you can create users as follows:
- Parent account with admin privileges
- Child accounts with limited access
- Configure with actual MAC addresses to test internet control

## Other Notes
- The system is designed to run on a dedicated computer/server in the home
- Raspberry Pi is an ideal deployment platform for this application
- Keep sensitive information like router passwords secure
